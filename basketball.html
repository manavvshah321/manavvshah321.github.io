				<h2>Basketball</h2>
				<p>I started playing basketball in high schools where I was the captain of my team. We have won 2 tournaments and achieved the runner-up position many times. My favorite team is the <b>Golden State Warriors</b> and my favorite player is <b>Stephen Curry</b>. </p>
				<p> Milwaukee Bucks won the 2021 NBA Finals. These were the following rankings of the team at the end of the season:</p> 
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Milwaukee Bucks</li>
					<li>Philadelphia 76ers</li>
					<li>Brooklyn Nets</li>
					<li>New York Knicks</li>
					<li>Atlanta Hawks</li>
					<li>Miami Heats</li>
				</ol>
