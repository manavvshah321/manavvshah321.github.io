				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Hello! My name is Manavv Shah. I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, pursuing a major in Industrial Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I'm from Mumbai, India and joined this college in 2018. Some of my hobbies are playing basketball, chess and a little photography whenever I am travelling. Besides this, I am an active member of some NGOs in Mumbai, where we help educate underprivileged students. This website will give you a little insight on me, my hobbies and some of my photography pictures as well!</p>
