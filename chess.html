				<h2>Chess</h2>
				<p>I started playing chess at 12 years old by joining a chess coaching class. I really enjoyed it and started playing regularly ever since. After starting college, I have stopped playing until the recent show <b>Queens Gambit</b> came out. After that I have started playing and learning again. My favorite chess player is <b>Magnus Carlsen</b> - he is a Norwegian Chess Grandmaster. I have watched many of his games and it was interesting to see how his thought process worked.</p>
